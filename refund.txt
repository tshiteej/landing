Refund Policy
Last updated: December 29, 2025

1. Subscription Plans
Knowtly offers subscription-based services for our note-taking and knowledge management platform. We want you to be satisfied with your purchase, but we also want to provide a sustainable service to our community.

2. Refund Eligibility
We offer a 14-day money-back guarantee for all new subscriptions. If you are not satisfied with our services within the first 14 days after your initial purchase, you may request a full refund.

To be eligible for a refund:
The refund request must be made within 14 days of the initial purchase.
You must provide a reason for the refund request (this helps us improve).
Your account must be in good standing.
3. Non-Refundable Items
The following are not eligible for refunds:

Purchases made beyond the 14-day refund window.
Subscription renewals (after the initial subscription period).
Accounts that have violated our Terms of Service.
Usage-based charges (if applicable) that have already been incurred.
4. How to Request a Refund
To request a refund, please contact our support team at support@knowtly.app with the following information:

Your account email address.
Date of purchase.
Reason for requesting the refund.
5. Refund Processing
Refunds will be processed through our payment processor (e.g., Stripe, Paddle, or Apple/Google if purchased via app stores).

Once approved, refunds typically take 5-10 business days to process, depending on your payment method and financial institution.

6. Subscription Cancellation
Canceling your subscription will stop future billing but will not automatically generate a refund for previous charges. You may continue to access the service until the end of your current billing period.

To cancel your subscription, log in to your account and go to the billing settings, or contact our support team at support@knowtly.app.

7. Changes to This Policy
We reserve the right to modify this refund policy at any time. If we make changes, we will notify you by updating the date at the top of this policy.
